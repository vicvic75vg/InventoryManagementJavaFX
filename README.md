# InventoryManagementJavaFX
A fully functional inventory management system created with Java and the JavaFX SDK.

## Functionality
This application tracks two things, Parts, and Products. A user is able to add parts and their part name, part stock level, part minimum and maximum stock level, and part price. These parts can be categorized into either outsourced or made in-house. An in-house part will allow the user to set a machine ID where the part came from, while the outsourced part will allow the user to set a company name where the part was manufactured. 

Apart from adding parts, users will also be able to modify or delete existing parts. The list of all parts is shown in a TableView on the main screen alongside the products.

Products, on the other hand, can be created with the same parameters, however, products may consist of various parts. For example, a Keyboard product may have 104 key parts associated with it. Products can be added, modified, or deleted as well. 

## Purpose
This application was created to demonstrate the use of object-oriented programming in the Java programming language, using the JavaFX SDK and Javadoc.
